### *Regio Vinco* Map Editor
[Software Design Description (PDF)](../docs/RigioVincoMapEditorSDD.pdf){:target="_blank"}

*Regio Vinco* is a map-picking game proided by the professor ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXFr6on4Yug){:target="_blank"}). The *Regio Vinco* Map Editor is a editing software written in Java that can construct maps for the game. The editor use Simple App Framework to perform basic file operations. The editing file and exported map is constructed in JSON format.

This software is the first "big" project with user interface I have done, and which I learned the whole process of releasing a software, from software design to beta test and review.

### Seawolf Script
A simple "console" parser implemented with PLY (Python Lex-Yacc). Supports if statements, while loops and functions (procedures).

Sample executable code:

### (Bash-like) Unix Shell
A beta version. The basic functions and commands are same as Bash. Also supports additional keyboard shortcuts.

Circuit board was provided. I did soldering, coding and testing, which I enjoyed very much and discovered the difference of coding in Software Engineering and Electrical Engineering.
