The most programming language I have been coding for the longest time is Java, then C. I have specific interest on system level programming, while I am also learning front-end technologies and frameworks. </p>

	<p>Just a little more about me...</p>
	<p>When I am free or just want to temporarily ran away from courseworks, I play RPG or ARPG games, go out and play tennis, listen to songs by Aimer, or muse about everything, from human history to fantasy. By the way, I am also learning to improve my photography skills.</p>
