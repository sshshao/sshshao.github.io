I am a junor student at Stony Brook University, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science major. I have been attracted to computer technologies and gaming for years. The most programming language I have been coding for the longest time is Java, then C. I am also learning to improve my photography skills.

I am currently seeking 2017 Software Engineering Interns. [Read more about me](sshshao.github.io/about/) or get in touch at [shen.shao@stonybrook.edu](mailto: shen.shao@stonybrook.edu). I'd love to hear from you!
